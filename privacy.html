<h1>SpotAlert Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 15, 2025</p>

<p>At SpotAlert Inc. (“SpotAlert”, “we”, “our”, or “us”), your privacy and trust mean everything to us.  
This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how we keep it safe when you use our website, app, and smart-alert monitoring services (“Services”).  
By using SpotAlert, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign up, we collect basic details such as your name (optional), email address, and password so we can create and manage your account.</li>

<li><strong>Camera & Alert Data:</strong> When you connect cameras, SpotAlert may temporarily process images or short video frames for facial or motion detection.  
These files are used only to trigger alerts and are automatically deleted after processing unless you explicitly choose to save them.  
We never publicly share or sell this data.</li>

<li><strong>Device & Usage Data:</strong> We may collect limited technical information such as device type, browser, IP address, and timestamps to help us maintain service quality and security.</li>

<li><strong>Support & Communication:</strong> If you contact us for help, we store your message and contact details to respond and improve our support experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>To deliver and improve our security-alert services.</li>
<li>To send notifications (email, SMS, or push) when unusual activity is detected, if enabled by you.</li>
<li>To verify account ownership and prevent unauthorized use.</li>
<li>To personalize your dashboard and camera settings experience.</li>
<li>To comply with legal obligations and prevent abuse or fraud.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Your Control & Choices</h2>
<p>You control how much data you share with SpotAlert.  
You can update, download, or delete your account and all related data at any time from your dashboard or by contacting our support team.  
Turning off alerts, disconnecting cameras, or deleting your account will stop all related data processing immediately.</p>

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>We use industry-standard encryption, secure data centers, and continuous monitoring to keep your information safe.  
While no system is 100% immune to risk, SpotAlert is committed to identifying and resolving vulnerabilities quickly to protect your privacy.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We keep your information only for as long as necessary to provide the Services and comply with legal or security obligations.  
If you delete your account, your personal data and stored media are permanently removed within 30 days, unless required by law to retain longer (for example, billing records).</p>

<h2>6. Sharing & Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>We never sell or rent your personal data.  
We only share limited information with trusted partners who help us operate SpotAlert — such as email delivery services, cloud storage, or payment processors — all under strict confidentiality and security agreements.  
These partners are only allowed to use data to perform their specific function for us.</p>

<h2>7. AI & Facial Recognition Transparency</h2>
<p>SpotAlert uses artificial-intelligence algorithms to detect faces or movement in camera feeds.  
Facial data is analyzed locally or securely in the cloud to classify known vs. unknown individuals.  
Unless you enable storage or recognition lists, image data is processed temporarily and automatically deleted after detection.  
You can manage, edit, or remove recognized faces anytime from your account settings.</p>

<h2>8. Cookies & Website Tracking</h2>
<p>Our website uses essential cookies to help you stay signed in and remember your preferences.  
We may also use small analytics tools (like Google Analytics) to understand how visitors use SpotAlert, but these do not include identifiable personal data.  
You can disable cookies in your browser settings, though some features may not work correctly without them.</p>

<h2>9. International Users & Data Transfers</h2>
<p>SpotAlert is a global service.  
Your information may be processed in secure data centers in the United States, Canada, or other regions depending on where you live.  
We follow international data-protection rules (including GDPR and PIPEDA) to ensure your information remains protected wherever it’s processed.</p>

<h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>SpotAlert is intended for use by adults 18 years or older.  
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.  
If you believe a child has created an account, please contact us and we will remove the data immediately.</p>

<h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>SpotAlert Inc. provides its Services “as is.”  
We are not liable for indirect or consequential damages resulting from use of our Services.  
Our total liability shall not exceed the total amount you have paid to SpotAlert in the past 12 months.</p>

<h2>12. Updates to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements.  
If changes are significant, we’ll notify you by email or app notice before they take effect.  
Continuing to use SpotAlert means you accept the updated policy.</p>
