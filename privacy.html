<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 7, 2025</p>

<p>SpotAlert Inc. (“SpotAlert”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our platform, services, or apps (“Services”).</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign up, we collect your email, password, and any optional profile details.</li>
<li><strong>Camera & Alert Data:</strong> When connecting your cameras, we temporarily process image data to detect activity or unknown persons. We do not publicly store video feeds or facial data unless you explicitly authorize cloud backup.</li>
<li><strong>Communication:</strong> We collect emails or messages sent to support to improve service response.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

<li>To ensure account security and prevent fraud.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Security</h2>
<p>We use encryption and AWS infrastructure to protect your stored and transmitted data. No method of storage is 100% secure; however, we apply commercially acceptable means to safeguard it.</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain your account and alert data only as long as necessary for operational and legal purposes. Users can delete their accounts anytime, which permanently removes data unless required by law.</p>

<h2>5. Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
<p>We do not sell or rent user data. We may share limited data with trusted partners solely for alert delivery, email notifications, and payment processing (e.g., Stripe, AWS SES).</p>
