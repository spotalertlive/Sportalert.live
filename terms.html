<h1>SpotAlert Terms of Service</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 15, 2025</p>

<p>Welcome to SpotAlert! üëã  
We‚Äôre glad you‚Äôre here. These terms explain how you can use our products and services (the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù) safely and responsibly.  
By using SpotAlert, you‚Äôre agreeing to these terms ‚Äî please take a few minutes to read them carefully.</p>

<h2>1. Creating an Account</h2>
<p>You‚Äôll need an account to access certain features. Please use accurate information when signing up and keep your login details secure.  
You‚Äôre responsible for everything that happens under your account, so choose a strong password and don‚Äôt share it with others.</p>

<h2>2. Using SpotAlert Responsibly</h2>
<ul>
<li>SpotAlert is designed to help you monitor, protect, and stay informed ‚Äî not to invade anyone‚Äôs privacy or break laws.</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt use our system to harm, track, or harass others. Any misuse can lead to suspension or permanent account termination.</li>
<li>We may monitor usage for security and compliance purposes to protect all users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Plans, Payments, and Renewals</h2>
<p>We offer both free trials and paid plans.  
Paid plans renew automatically each billing cycle unless you cancel before your renewal date.  
All payments are handled securely through trusted providers such as Stripe.  
Taxes or additional processing fees may apply depending on your region.</p>

<h2>4. Free Trials</h2>
<p>You can test SpotAlert with a free trial before subscribing to a paid plan.  
We strongly encourage all new users to start with the free trial to ensure your cameras, devices, and network setup are fully compatible,  
and that SpotAlert provides the level of monitoring you expect.  
This helps confirm that everything works smoothly before any payments are made.</p>

<p>Because every setup is different, we can‚Äôt guarantee performance on unsupported or incompatible devices once a paid plan begins.  
By completing a purchase, you acknowledge that you‚Äôve had the chance to test the service and confirm it meets your needs.</p>

<h2>5. Alerts and Notifications</h2>
<p>SpotAlert helps you stay aware through alerts (like email, SMS, or push notifications).  
We‚Äôll do our best to deliver them quickly, but we can‚Äôt control every network or email provider.  
Please double-check that your contact details and alert settings are correct so you don‚Äôt miss any important notifications.</p>

<h2>6. Ownership and Copyright</h2>
<p>Everything you see or use on SpotAlert ‚Äî including our logo, software, and interface ‚Äî belongs to SpotAlert Inc.  
You can‚Äôt copy, resell, or reverse-engineer any part of our platform without written permission.</p>

<h2>7. Our Responsibility</h2>
<p>We work hard to keep SpotAlert reliable, but sometimes things can go wrong (like internet outages or third-party issues).  
Our services are provided ‚Äúas is,‚Äù and we can‚Äôt be held responsible for losses caused by technical interruptions or misuse.  
If something ever goes wrong, our total liability won‚Äôt exceed what you‚Äôve paid us in the last 12 months.</p>

<h2>8. Cancelling or Closing Your Account</h2>
<p>You can cancel anytime in your dashboard or by contacting us.  
If you break these terms, we may suspend or close your account to protect the system and other users.  
When an account is closed, we may delete related data for safety and privacy reasons.</p>

<h2>9. Updates to These Terms</h2>
<p>We might make small updates as SpotAlert grows or as laws change.  
If we make big changes, we‚Äôll notify you beforehand.  
Continuing to use SpotAlert after updates means you accept the revised terms.</p>

<h2>10. Need Help?</h2>
